- nonlinear_fit.format is irritating with its nline. Replace with a verbose flag? Rather keep nline (set to 100, say), but use the verbose flag to 
indicate whether to print or not. Default for verbose should be what?

- do more extensive testing of exceptions in lsqfit using unittest's easy framework (with self.assertRaises(ValueError):  stmt). Should be able to get the 93% (missing 39 statements) coverage closer to 100%.

- simplify the unittests. Get away from the complicated loops over many variations and simply list variations one at a time --- code easier to read and also easier to figure out which variation failed if not using loops (most important reason).

- Build a more efficient mode for pickling BufferDicts containing GDevs. Current approach reconstructs the GDevs from their means and from their covariance matrix. Using the covariance matrix is suboptimal if there are many GDevs derived from just a few (in which case the covariance matrix can be expressed in a way that is very sparse). Ideally you would find a way to store the sparse matrix, in terms of the underlying variables, and then store the derivatives for each GDev relative to the underlying variables. As I write this it isn't clear that this is indeed more efficient because in many cases we want to pickle a small number of variables that depend upon a much larger number of underlying variables --- in which case we are better off leaving things the way they are. ?????
