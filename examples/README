These .py files are simple examples showing how to use lsqfit. Use 'make run' 
to run all of them, comparing the output with the corresponding .out files.

Some of these examples are discussed in the documentation (which is doc/html/index.html).

To run under a different version of python, say python3 for example, use 
'make PYTHON=python3 run'.
