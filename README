lsqfit
------
This directory contains all of the pieces that go into the general
least-squares fitting package called lsqfit. 

Documentation on how to use the various modules defined here can be found
in the doc/ subdirectory (see doc/html/index.html for the html version or
doc/lsqfit.pdf for a pdf version (the html is better)). There are two major
modules (gvar.so and lsqfit.py) and one utility module (lsqfit_util.so).

Information on how to install the various components is in the INSTALLATION
file.

To test the libraries try 'make tests'. (Some tests involve random numbers and
so may occasionally --- less than 1 in 100 runs --- fail due to rare
multi-sigma fluctuations; rerun the tests if they do fail.) Some examples are
give in the examples/ subdirectory.
