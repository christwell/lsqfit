This directory contains all the source code for the lsqfit/gvar 
documentation.

- The large code output blocks in the overview.rst are generated by running
  all of egX.py (eg5.py has to be run twice, with USE_SVD True and False).

- The only figure (fig1) is generated by running eg1.py with DO_PLOT set to
  True.
